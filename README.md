# Chess Engine
My attempt at trying to figure how to write a chess engine from scratch.

## Features
- Internal bitboard representation
- Alpha-beta pruned search
- Move generation API

## TODOs
- Move ordering for faster forward search
- Opening book
- Non-trivial board state evaluation using better heuristics

## Usage
Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the 
following command.
```bash
python -m chessengine.play 
```
