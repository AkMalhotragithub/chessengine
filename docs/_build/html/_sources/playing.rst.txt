Playing A Game
==============

.. note::

    The current version of chessengine has not yet implemented all rules of
    chess. A few move-related bugs are also known and under development.

    * King moves -
        * Moves generated by other pieces are not checked to make sure they do not place the king in check
        * The king generates moves that move it into check
        * The king isn't required to move itself out of check
    * Pawn promotion -
        * Pawns are not promoted when they reach the last rank
    * Stalemate -
        * The engine still asks for a move if the user is stalemated
        * If the engine is stalemated, it crashes
    * SAN input by user is not verified for correctness -
        * SAN moves that are ambiguous are accepted as valid, and a piece is chosen by the engine
        * SAN moves that are invalid throw an error instead of giving the user a chance to enter the move again
    * Castling -
        * Castling is accepted after the rook has moved
        * Castling is accepted after the king has moved
    * En-passant moves -
        * The engine does not make en-passant moves
        * The engine does not allow the user to make en-passant moves

The recommended way to play a game on the console is by using the command -

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m chessengine.play

Enter the side you want to play - "w" for white and "b" for black.
